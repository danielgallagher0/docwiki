The text allowed in [DocWiki] pages is a simplification of [reStructuredText:http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html], which generates a subset of HTML.  The basic idea behind reStructuredText and DocWiki is that it is simple and easy to write.

/*Hyperlinks*/
    - Wikilinks are intra-wiki links.  Wikilinks are embedded in square brackets, as in {[DocWiki]}
    - External links are written as {[Google:http://www.google.com]}
    - Links to doxygen documentation are written as {[doc:project:entity]}, where {project} is a project named in {projectIndex.xml}, and {entity} is any class or function included in the doxygen.  See [DocWikiConfiguration] for how to set up {projectIndex.xml} and setting up Doxygen for including in DocWiki.

/*Structure*/
    - Paragraphs are separated by blank lines
    - Bulleted lists are created by putting dashes ({-}) at the beginning of the line at the same indentation.
    - Numbered lists are created by putting hash marks ({#}) at the beginning of the line at the same indentation.
    - Nested lists (of any kind) are created by creating a list at a deeper indentation than the current list.

{This sentence would show up in its own paragraph.

    - The start of a bulleted list
    - Another entry
        # A sub-list that is numbered
        # Item 2
    - Back at the original list}

/*Formatting*/
    - Bold text is created by using asterisks, e.g., {*bold text*}
    - Italicized text is created by using slashes, e.g., {/italicized text/}
    - Monospaced text is created by using curly brackets, e.g., {{monospaced text}}
